        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>HeadsUp HR Solutions ("we", "us", "our") operates the mobile application <strong>Pocket CTS</strong> (the "App").

          <tr><td class="small"><strong>Storage / File Access</strong></td><td class="small">Used to read and write files for downloading candidate reports, uploading resumes, and opening attachments (PDF/Excel).</td></tr>
          <tr><td class="small"><strong>Notifications</strong></td><td class="small">Used with Firebase Cloud Messaging to deliver interview reminders and HR updates (if enabled).</td></tr>
        </table>
